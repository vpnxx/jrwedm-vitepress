| **Ratio** | **1: 12ï½ž15**, dilute directly with tap water (avoid hard water such as well water or groundwater). |
| **Composition** | Environmentally friendly components. |
| **Application Scope** | Used for cooling in electrical discharge machining (EDM) wire cutting of various metal materials; also suitable for cooling in metal cutting processes. |
| **Features** | 1. Produces a uniform and white cutting surface without reciprocation marks (after kerosene cleaning).<br>2. Suitable for high-current cutting (above 3.5A for standard machines, above 5A for medium-speed wire-cut machines). Compared to traditional emulsified oil, cutting efficiency is increased by 30%, surface quality is improved by half a grade, electrode wire loss is reduced by 50%, and the service life of molybdenum wire is significantly extended.<br>3. The workpiece falls off automatically after cutting, is easy to clean, and keeps the workbench clean.<br>4. Suitable for processing mold steel with a thickness of **0-500mm** and for multiple cuts. |
| **Shelf Life** | 12 months |
| **Packaging** | Liquid, 18 kg/barrel. |
| **Appearance & Cautions** | 1. The concentrate is yellow, and the diluted fluid is a light milky white. This product has excellent cleaning properties.
