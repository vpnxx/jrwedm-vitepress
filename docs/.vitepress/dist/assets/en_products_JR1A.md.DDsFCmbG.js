Produces a uniform and white cutting surface without reciprocation marks (after kerosene cleaning).<br>2. Suitable for high-current cutting (above 3.5A for standard machines, above 5A for medium-speed wire-cut machines). Compared to traditional emulsified oil, cutting efficiency is increased by 30%, surface quality is improved by half a grade, electrode wire loss is reduced by 50%, and the service life of molybdenum wire is significantly extended.<br>3. The workpiece falls off automatically after cutting, is easy to clean, and keeps the workbench clean.<br>4. Suitable for processing mold steel with a thickness of <strong>0-500mm</strong> and for multiple cuts.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;"><strong>Shelf Life</strong></td><td style="text-align:left;">12 months</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;"><strong>Packaging</strong></td><td style="text-align:left;">Liquid, 18 kg/barrel.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;"><strong>Appearance &amp; Cautions</strong></td><td style="text-align:left;">1.
